This package provides a variety of utilities to implement interatomic potentials, including e.g. generic functionality for site potentials and pair potentials, combination calculators, subsystem calculators and so forth. It also provides some simple tools for testing.

At the moment this package only implements the high-level AtomsCalculators 0.2 interface, but not yet the low-level interface, in particular the conventions for parameterized models still needs to be implemented.
